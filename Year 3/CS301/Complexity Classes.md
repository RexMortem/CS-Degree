## RP

## Showing $ZPP \subseteq RP$

Can turn a TM for ZPP to a TM for RP by:
- accepting/rejecting when receiving accept/reject
- reject when receiving "dunno"

## Showing $ZPP \subseteq coRP$

Combining this with the previous, $ZPP \subseteq RP \cap coRP$

### Showing $RP \cap coRP = ZPP$

We already have $ZPP \subseteq RP \cap coRP$, so we just need to show $RP \cap coRP \subseteq ZPP$.
