Have an input and labelled output where:
- input is the **feature vectors** ($\{x_{i}\}$)
- output is the **labels/targets** ($\{y_{i}\}$)

The goal of Supervised Learning is to guess $\{y_{i}\}$ from $\{x_{i}\}$.




Problem: learning for a condition which rarely happens (since a rule that always assumes it doesn't happen would have high accuracy)
