## May's Theorem

For $m=2$, majority rule is the only SCF that satisfies anonymity, neutrality, and positive responsiveness.

**Majority Rule:** Option preferred by the most votes wins

**Anonymity:** All voters must be treated the same 

**Neutrality:** All candidates must be treated the same 

**Positive Responsiveness:** Monotonicity (i.e. if candidate $X$ is winning or tied, then changing someone's vote to $X$ should make $X$ winning)

### Alternative forms of May's Theorem

## The Condorcet Paradox

Majority rule may contain cycles, for 3 or more candidates.

**Condorcet winners** are maximum elements
