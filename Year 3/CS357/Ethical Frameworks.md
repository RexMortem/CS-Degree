Normative ethics vs Applied ethics.

## Utilitarianism

Very simply, the greatest happiness principle.

It is a consequentialist approach to ethics, meaning that whether an action is ethical or not should be judged based on the consequences of that action - in this case, it should be judged based on the "happiness" that the action generates.
## Virtue Ethics

Less about strict rules and obligations, but more about what a "good person" would do - it's a pretty vibes based ethical framework.

This makes it the most practical ethical framework but also quite hard to pin down. 

## Deontology
